## XVRenderer
This a hobby project where I am trying to learn and write my own graphics renderer using Vulkan API. 

This library is part of an engine project.

## Current Status
- Working on wrapping VK with RAII principles.
- Setting up the rendering pipeline.

## External Libraries
- Vulkan Library (Graphics API)
- GLM (Math Library)
- GLFW (Platform Library)
